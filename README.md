Every drive, park and charge of your EQA, EQB, EQE, EQS, EQV, electric CLA or other Mercedes EV, kept in Home Assistant for as long as you like: where you went, how far, how much battery and energy it took, what the car lost while parked, and what each charge cost. Label trips Business, Commute or Personal and export them for mileage claims.

It reads your car from René's integration and never talks to Mercedes itself. Everything stays on your Home Assistant.

## Highlights

| | |
|---|---|
| 🚗 **Trips** | Start and end, distance, battery used, kWh, efficiency, outside temperature and the route on a map |
| 🅿️ **Parked drain** | What the car lost between trips, and an idle-drain sensor in % per day |
| ⚡ **Charging** | Every session with kWh, peak power and cost, from your own rates per place (with an optional off-peak window) or a live price sensor; rate history keeps old costs right |
| 🏷️ **Mileage claims** | Business / Commute / Personal labels, a default label per place, column filters, mileage by label and CSV export |
| 📍 **Your own places** | Name any stop with a draggable, resizable circle; the name reaches back through all your history |
| 🔥 **Where you go** | A heat map of every stop: by month, 3 months, year or all time |
| 🔋 **Battery health** | The range the car predicts at 100%, month by month |
| 🌡️ **Efficiency vs temperature** | How much winter really costs you, from Home Assistant's own weather |
| 🕘 **Your past trips too** | On install it rebuilds earlier trips and charges from Home Assistant's history |
| 🛠️ **Fix the odd bad trip** | Split, merge or delete |
| 🚙🚙 **Several cars** | Add each car; the card and page switch between them |

## Screenshots

**Trips:** labels (picked or automatic from the place), charges shown between trips, sortable columns and CSV export.

## Install

[![Open in HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=david40i9&repository=ha-mercedes-ev-logbook&category=integration)

1. In **HACS**, search for **Mercedes EV Logbook** (or use the button above).
2. Select **Download**, then restart Home Assistant.
3. Go to **Settings → Devices & services → Add integration → Mercedes EV Logbook** ([open it](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=mb_logbook)) and pick your car.

<details>
<summary>Manual install</summary>

Download the latest [release](https://github.com/david40i9/ha-mercedes-ev-logbook/releases), copy `custom_components/mb_logbook` into your `config/custom_components` folder and restart Home Assistant.
</details>

The **Mercedes EV Logbook** page appears in the sidebar, and the card is registered for your dashboards automatically.

## Setup

Pick the car from the Mercedes integration and its sensors are filled in for you, along with the **usable battery capacity** for its model (check it: capacities changed between model years):

| Model | Usable kWh (approx.) |
|---|---|
| EQA / EQB | 66.5 |
| CLA (electric) | 85 |
| EQC | 80 |
| EQE saloon / SUV | 89 – 90.6 |
| EQS saloon / SUV | 107.8 – 108.4 |
| EQV | 90 |

Check your model year's spec sheet; capacities changed between versions. Choose the **currency** for charging costs (it starts as Home Assistant's). Everything can be changed later with **Configure**.

### What it uses

| | Needed? | What it adds |
|---|---|---|
| Odometer, battery %, GPS tracker | **Yes** | Trips, distance, energy and routes |
| Ignition state | Optional | The most precise trip start and end (otherwise trips are detected from the car moving) |
| Trip distance counter | Optional | 0.1-mile/km trip distances when the odometer only reports whole units |
| Charging active, charging power | Optional | Charging sessions, peak power, and home kWh when there is no charger meter |
| Electricity price sensor | Optional | Live price for home charges (per kWh or MWh, pounds, pence, euros, cents, öre…; converted automatically). Without one, home charges use the rates you set in the Charging tab |
| Home charger energy meter | Optional | The most accurate home energy, losses included (any total-kWh sensor: Zappi, Wallbox, Ohme, smart plug, CT clamp…). Without one, home kWh comes from the car's charging power over the session, else its battery % |
| Outside temperature | Optional | Defaults to Home Assistant's weather for your home; or pick any temperature sensor |

Any car that provides these entities works, not only Mercedes. Pick them yourself in the setup form.

## Using it

**Sidebar page.** *Overview* shows this month against last; mileage by label for any week, month, 3 months or year; 12-month charts of distance, energy, charging cost and efficiency; battery health; efficiency against outside temperature; this month's routes; your most-visited places; and a heat map of where you go. *Logbook* is the full card for the selected car.

**Trips.** Click a trip to see its route. Choose a label from the dropdown, or give a place a default label (Places tab) and trips there are labelled automatically. Filter with the dropdowns under the column headers (place, label, distance, charged or not) or the label buttons; the totals follow, and **Export CSV** saves the trips shown. The Charging tab filters the same way, by place (or home / away) and how each charge was costed.

**Places.** A stop outside your Home Assistant zones shows as *unnamed · name it*. Name it and drag the circle to fit; every past and future trip or charge there takes the name. Press **Suggest names** for nearby shops and venues from OpenStreetMap.

**Charging rates.** Give any charging place, Home included, a price per kWh (or mark it free) from a date, with an optional off-peak price and time window for EV tariffs (for example 7p from 00:30 to 05:30). Each charge is costed at the rate in force when it started, split by how much of it fell in the off-peak window, so a new rate never changes older charges. No price sensor or energy integration is needed. Costs are shown in the currency chosen in the car's options.

**Fixing trips.** Open a trip for **Split at the stop** (two drives logged as one, for example after the car lost signal in an underground car park), **Merge with next trip**, or **Delete this trip**.

**Several cars.** Add each car as its own entry; the card and page get a car switcher. Rename a car (for example to "Sam's CLA") under **Configure**: the name shows in the switcher, the device and its sensors, while entity IDs stay the same. Cars on the same home charger meter share it by charging power, never counted twice.

**Monthly summary** (optional, in the car's options): last month's trips, distance, energy, charging and idle drain, sent on the 1st at 09:00 as a Home Assistant notification or through any notify service. The **Send monthly summary** action sends it now.

<details>
<summary>Dashboard card</summary>

The card is registered as a dashboard resource automatically; add it from the card picker or in YAML:

```yaml
type: custom:mb-logbook-card
period: month     # week, month, quarter or year
# car: EQS        # optional: lock the card to one car (by name)
```

If your dashboards are in YAML mode, the resource can't be added for you, so the card is loaded another way that some browsers (Firefox) can cache without it. If the card doesn't show, add `/mb_logbook/mb-logbook-card.js` as a JavaScript module under `resources:` in your Lovelace YAML.

<details>
<summary>Sensors (per car)</summary>

| Sensor | |
|---|---|
| Trips, distance, energy used, efficiency | This month |
| Last trip distance, energy, efficiency | With from, to and battery as attributes |
| Idle drain | % per day lost while parked (uncharged parks of 6 h or more, last 30 days) |
| Last charge energy and cost | |
| Charged, charging cost | This month |
| Trip in progress, charging session | Binary sensors |
</details>

<details>
<summary>Actions</summary>

- **Import history**: rebuild trips and charges from Home Assistant's recorded history for the time before the car was added. It runs once automatically; re-running replaces only imported rows, never live ones.
- **Send monthly summary**: send last month's summary now.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How trips are detected</summary>

A trip starts when the ignition leaves "off" and ends when it has been off for a few minutes (3 by default). If the car stops moving for 30 minutes while its ignition still says "on" (it can lose signal before reporting the ignition off), the trip ends at the last movement and the next drive starts a new one.

Without an ignition sensor, a trip starts when the car moves (odometer or trip counter up, or a position jump of 200 m or more) and ends after the same few minutes without movement.

Distance comes from the car's 0.1-resolution "distance since start" counter, checked against the odometer. Ignition events that don't move the car, such as pre-conditioning, are ignored.

Data is stored in `config/mb_logbook.db` (SQLite), which is included in Home Assistant backups.
</details>

## Privacy

Everything stays in Home Assistant. Places are named from your own zones and the places you name. The one exception is optional: **Suggest names** sends the single point you are naming to OpenStreetMap's Photon service (falling back to the Overpass API), only when you press it. Route maps use Home Assistant's own map component and tiles.

Everyone with a login to your Home Assistant can open the logbook page and see trips, routes and charges. Only administrators can change or delete anything.

## Limits

- Mercedes reports battery % in whole numbers, so kWh for short trips is approximate (1% of a large battery is about 1 kWh).
- The car sends its position about every two minutes while driving, so routes are drawn point to point.

## Thanks

This integration depends entirely on [MercedesME 2020 (mbapi2020)](https://github.com/ReneNulschDE/mbapi2020), which [René Nulsch (@ReneNulschDE)](https://github.com/ReneNulschDE) builds and maintains, connecting Mercedes me to Home Assistant. Every trip, charge and battery reading here comes through his work. If it helps you, consider supporting his project.

## Contributing

Bug reports and ideas are welcome in [Issues](https://github.com/david40i9/ha-mercedes-ev-logbook/issues). Planned work is in [TODO.md](https://github.com/david40i9/ha-mercedes-ev-logbook/blob/main/TODO.md).

The tests run Home Assistant itself with a simulated car (trips, charging, restarts, the history import and the card's commands). They need Python 3.14:

```bash
pip install -r requirements_test.txt
ruff check .
pytest
```
